   <h1>How to play</h1>

   <h2>Hello and welcome to CSGOBattle. Here you will go through a fun experience of playing against other players for skins, in variety of modes. Here’s a ‘how-to’ get started.</h2>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Make sure you have the correct trade link and SteamID connected to your account. You can add both from your profile.</li>
        <li>Now you must find an opponent to verse against and there are multiple ways to do so. One, if you have a direct profile link to the person you want to challenge, you can challenge them directly from their profile. Want to play against ranked players? Then go to the ladders page that is located on the left-side menu from any page. There you can challenge a variety of different players. The main place to find an opponent would be the discover page, it shows players who want to get challenged right now, and for which value of skins. You can make ‘your-self’ visible on the page from your profile. Again, challenge them and see if they would like to play with you.</li>
        <li>Once an opponent has accepted your challenge, you will receive a notification and the match will be added to “Your matches”.</li>
        <li>Go the the desired Match, there you will have your inventory loaded and you can start putting in skins for which you would like to play. There’s a chat on the page, so you can negotiate and confirm the match with your opponent.</li>
        <li>Once both players agree to play, the bot will send them trade requests. When both of players skins get deposited to the bot, the Match has started.</li>
        <li>You will now receive information regarding the server to play on, you both must join the server to play out the match on. Once you finish playing, you click on the site whether you have lost or won. (Please be sincere, it's fairly easy for us to find out who won or lost, and the match won't go through and you will only waste your own and others time, as well as get banned).</li>
        <li>Once both players agree on the result, the bot will send out the winnings to the players.</li>
        <li>Rinse and repeat, enjoy your stay on the site.</li>
    </ol>
