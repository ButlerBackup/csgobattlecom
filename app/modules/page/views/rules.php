    <li>
        <b>1. When starting a match you must follow these rules</b>
        <ol class="rules_1">
            <li>When accepting a match,  you agree to select the proper resolution upon completing your match against the opponent. If you won the match click “I won”, or vise versa if you lost the match click “I lost”. If you don't agree, with the opposite decision, or you are lying, the match will be sent to disputes. Once in disputes the match will get an overview, in which the person giving the inaccurate answer will be punished and the skins will be sent to the real winner. Such offenses might be punished up to a permanent ban, which will happen if you are consistently providing false information.</li>
            <li>Finish your match, don't rage, you might always think the other party is hacking, but if he is proven to be clean, you will accept a punishment of admins choice. Don't run around calling hacks if you lose your skins, especially in modes in which it is nearly impossible to cheat.</li>
            <li>If a user is abusive, trying to get you to place more items, fishy, sending you to click links, asking you to perform the bet outside of our system please DON'T ACCEPT THE TRADE, if you do get scammed by listening to the scammer, we are not liable for any losses. Again, don't click any links, place more items than needed, or play outside of our site.</li>
            <li>Double check the items you have posted, making sure there are no mistakes so you don't lose/place more than the opponent.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>2. By placing a bet against another user, you automatically agree with our rules and regulations.</li>
    <li>3. If you do not agree with the rules, we suggest not to proceed with using our site.</li>
